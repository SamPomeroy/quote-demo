About Us
Create Membership Plans that Patients and Providers Love
As everyone knows, dental health is critical to overall health. Unfortunately, dental insurance is too complicated, too confusing, and too expensive for dentists and patients alike. As a result, 40% of US consumers do not have dental coverage, 50% of US consumers do not visit a dentist each year, and dentists continue to struggle with practice success while managing complicated insurance plans with low reimbursement fees, coverage limits and claims denials.

Company Overview
Our mission is to make professional oral care accessible to everyone with a membership model that patients and providers love.
We are doing something about this. We connect dentists directly with patients to eliminate the inefficiency, cost, and hassle of workarounds. Using our cloud-based platform, dentists easily design, implement, and grow a successful membership plan with their own dental care plans, offering them directly to patients. The result is affordable, comprehensive dental coverage that works for dental practices and enables patients to get the professional oral care they need.
As the established leaders in the dental membership space, Kleer and Membersy support a combined footprint of over 20,000 dentists and millions of patients across all 50 states, and cover the entire spectrum of dental practices, from independent solo practices to the largest DSOs in the country.
Kleer and Membersy came together in 2024 to provide an unmatched dental membership solution and experience. Leveraging their complementary strengths, industry expertise, and scale, Kleer and Membersy will create significant value for DSOs, independent dental practices, and their patients by expanding access to care for all uninsured and underinsured Americans, including more than 76 million adults without dental insurance.

About Us
Create Membership Plans that Patients and Providers Love
As everyone knows, dental health is critical to overall health. Unfortunately, dental insurance is too complicated, too confusing, and too expensive for dentists and patients alike. As a result, 40% of US consumers do not have dental coverage, 50% of US consumers do not visit a dentist each year, and dentists continue to struggle with practice success while managing complicated insurance plans with low reimbursement fees, coverage limits and claims denials.

Company Overview
Our mission is to make professional oral care accessible to everyone with a membership model that patients and providers love.
We are doing something about this. We connect dentists directly with patients to eliminate the inefficiency, cost, and hassle of workarounds. Using our cloud-based platform, dentists easily design, implement, and grow a successful membership plan with their own dental care plans, offering them directly to patients. The result is affordable, comprehensive dental coverage that works for dental practices and enables patients to get the professional oral care they need.
As the established leaders in the dental membership space, Kleer and Membersy support a combined footprint of over 20,000 dentists and millions of patients across all 50 states, and cover the entire spectrum of dental practices, from independent solo practices to the largest DSOs in the country.
Kleer and Membersy came together in 2024 to provide an unmatched dental membership solution and experience. Leveraging their complementary strengths, industry expertise, and scale, Kleer and Membersy will create significant value for DSOs, independent dental practices, and their patients by expanding access to care for all uninsured and underinsured Americans, including more than 76 million adults without dental insurance.

JOB DESCRIPTION

Position Title: Python Developer
Reports to: IT Project Manager of Enterprise Solutions Line of Business
Subsidiary: Leisnoi Professional Services, LLC
Location: Remote
Job Status: Regular Full -Time

SUMMARY:
The U.S. Census Bureau, Demographic Systems Division (DSD) requires support for Python development services in support of DSD’s migration of survey processing systems from Statistical Analysis System (SAS) to Python.

The Python Developer will assist with the development and documentation of the rewrite of The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) production processing system into a Python codebase. The scope of the SIPP Production processing consists of 200+ edit programs. Additionally, a revamped SIPP system, named SIPP Seamless, is currently in its planning phase. Therefore, the work outlined is for supporting the ongoing SIPP production system and the SIPP Seamless system.

As DSD migrates its infrastructure into the cloud, a CI/CD tool is required. Therefore, DSD is creating a collaborative space in GitLab for sharing Python code, where the developed code will reside, and pipelines can be established. The GitLab CI/CD will then need configuration and optimization to emulate current automation for the system.

Additionally, DSD is investigating leveraging a database to replace datasets that have thousands of variables. Therefore, converting the current SAS datasets into a normalized database structure is also in scope. The database research will evaluate the feasibility of replacing datasets to determine optimizations and efficiencies. In the event the database replacement is ideal, the Python Developer will be involved in developing the database design for the SIPP Seamless system.

The scope of work for this position is to provide support to the Income Surveys Programming Branch (ISPB) in The Demographic Systems Division (DSD) for the development of a Python-based system for performing demographic survey editing. DSD needs expertise in developing enterprise, Python solutions from a developer that can effectively cross-train existing staff based on their experience in advanced programming, knowledge of data structures, database experience, and version control familiarity. The Python Developer will work with DSD IT Specialists in an integrated team environment when performing services associated with this contract.

The Python Developer will perform knowledge transfers and training to keep current staff abreast of all activities they have performed and to share knowledge of products and techniques. Additionally, all procedural and development work performed requires clear documentation that can be replicated by current and future staff. This includes clearly documenting and verbally communicating through step-by-step procedures, presentations, explanations of Python coding, configuration settings with rationale, shadowing, and other techniques deemed appropriate by current staff and/or management to ensure adequate knowledge transfer. For technical demonstrations, the Python Developer will use a variety of skills and tools such as Python, SQL, PL/pgSQL, and Shell Scripting. For policy and procedural documentation, the contractor will create procedural documentation using software such as MS PowerPoint, MS Visio, MS Word, MS Excel, MS Teams, and MS SharePoint.

Essential Functions, Responsibilities & Duties may include, but are not limited to:

Today, through our business customers across the country, millions of consumers use Qualia to close on homes every year.
WHAT YOU'LL WORK ON
As a Site Reliability Engineer at Qualia, you will be a critical guardian of our core Resware systems and associated internal workflows. Your primary mission is to ensure the lights stay on, services remain robust, and our operational processes are well-understood and continuously improved. You won't just be fixing issues; you'll be investigating them to their root cause, understanding their impact on the broader ecosystem, and implementing solutions that prevent recurrence. This role is pivotal in maintaining the trust of our users and providing a stable foundation as Qualia undergoes a modernization initiative. You'll be the expert diagnostician for complex challenges within our .NET classic, Windows-based, on-premise software environment, and a key player in identifying opportunities to enhance reliability and reduce future operational burdens.
RESPONSIBILITIES
Operational Excellence & Service Continuity:
Troubleshoot & Resolve Critical Issues: Investigate, diagnose, and resolve complex technical issues in production and internal environments, particularly those related to SQL Server (upgrade scripts, index performance), Windows Server/IIS configurations, and our core Resware application (including ""mothership"" centralized processes and services).
Internal Tooling Stewardship: Own the maintenance, support, and enhancement of existing internal R&D tools. Research their purpose, understand their function within the larger development lifecycle, and ensure they remain effective and reliable.
Installer Management: Oversee the stability and functionality of the Resware installer, addressing any bugs or issues that arise during deployment or upgrades.
Incident Management & Root Cause Analysis (RCA): Lead or significantly contribute to the RCA process for incidents, ensuring that learnings are captured and preventative measures are identified and implemented.

System & Process Improvement:
Documentation & Knowledge Transfer: Meticulously document systems, processes, and troubleshooting guides to build a comprehensive knowledge base, reducing knowledge silos and enabling faster resolution of future issues.
Identify Automation Opportunities: While not primarily an automation role, keenly identify repetitive tasks, system inefficiencies, or areas prone to error that could be candidates for automation by the broader R&D team (e.g., DevOps engineers).
Contribute to Stability by Design: Provide feedback from an operational perspective to development teams, helping to ensure new features or changes are designed for stability and maintainability.
Process Optimization: Analyze existing operational procedures, identify bottlenecks or areas for improvement, and propose practical solutions to enhance efficiency and reliability.
Customer & Outcome Focus:
Understand Business Impact: Prioritize issues based on their potential impact on customers (internal and external) and business operations.
Collaborative Problem Solving: Work closely with other R&D team members, support teams, and IT to resolve issues and improve system health.
Effective Communication: Clearly communicate technical issues, proposed solutions, and project status to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
THE BACKGROUND THAT LIKELY MAKES YOU A MATCH
Proven Experience: Demonstrated experience (typically 5+ years) in a Technical Support Engineer (Tier 3+), Systems Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), or similar role focused on maintaining and troubleshooting complex software systems.
Technical Acumen:
Solid understanding of Windows Server environments and IIS configuration/management.
Proficiency with .NET framework applications (ability to understand code, debug, and diagnose issues, even if not actively developing new features).
Familiarity with scripting and IaC languages (e.g. PowerShell, Terraform) for diagnostics and minor automation tasks.
Strong expertise in Microsoft SQL Server administration, troubleshooting (query optimization, indexing, upgrade scripts).
Familiarity with Azure and cloud services.
Problem Solver & Analytical Thinker: You are driven to understand the ""why"" behind problems, not just apply surface-level fixes. You possess strong analytical and diagnostic skills, with an ability to think strategically about long-term solutions.
Documentation Champion: You believe in the power of good documentation and have experience creating and maintaining technical documentation.
Excellent Communicator: You can articulate complex technical concepts clearly and concisely to diverse audiences.
Customer Service Orientation: You are dedicated to providing excellent service and support to internal teams and, by extension, Qualia's customers.
Resware/Title Industry Experience (Highly Desirable): Prior experience with Resware or within the title and escrow industry would be a significant advantage, allowing you to understand the context of our tools and customer needs more quickly.
Proactive & Takes Ownership: You don't wait for issues to find you; you are proactive in identifying potential problems and taking ownership to drive them to resolution.
Collaborative Approach: You thrive in a team environment and understand the importance of collaboration to achieve common goals.
We are a remote-first development organization that values flexibility in how our teams work. In addition to supporting fully remote roles, we have offices in Austin and San Francisco, with a hybrid option available for those who live near an office and prefer in-person collaboration.

For more information on Turing, visit www.turing.com. For information on upcoming Turing AGI Icons events, visit go.turing.com/agi-icons.
About the Role
We’re looking for a curious, hands-on UI/UX Designer to join our fast-moving AI Prototyping team (UltraLab). This hybrid role blends deep UX thinking with a prototyping mindset to help us rapidly bring ideas to life across a wide range of industries.
You’ll create dynamic, interactive prototypes that shape how we build AI-powered products — both for our clients and internal initiatives at Turing.
UltraLab is responsible for translating business challenges into innovative AI solutions and delivering proof-of-concept prototypes at speed. As a UI/UX Designer, you’ll be a crucial bridge between vision and execution—helping ensure our concepts not only look great, but also feel real, functional, and ready for the next stage of development. Though this is not a coding role, it’s ideal for designers who are curious about using AI and modern tools to ship working UX fast.
You’ll also play a key role in evolving and applying the Ultralab brand identity, ensuring a consistent, future-forward visual and interaction language across everything we build — from quick demos to full-scale concepts.
Key Responsibilities
Design and build high-fidelity interactive prototypes using tools like v0.dev, Bolt or similar tools to validate ideas early and often — no front-end coding required.
For more complex or high-impact prototypes, use Figma to deliver polished, structured design flows.
Translate design concepts and wireframes into functioning UI aligned with user experience goals and Ultralab brand standards. Study existing user journeys and propose AI-enhanced alternatives; collaborate with PMs to finalize revised flows that are practical and user-centered. Collaborate with Product Managers to shape user flows and define requirements, and with developers to ensure smooth handoffs and technical feasibility. Support usability testing and feedback loops by rapidly iterating on prototypes based on real user insights. Create and reuse flexible design patterns to ensure consistency across evolving prototypes — and contribute to a lightweight, scalable design system. Help define, evolve, and apply the UltraLab brand identity — ensuring even quick-turnaround builds feel cohesive, intentional, and thoughtful. Explore and integrate emerging tools and AI-assisted design workflows, pushing the boundaries of what modern UX can look and feel like. Ensure prototypes are intuitive, accessible, and responsive across devices and platforms. Participate in cross-functional brainstorms, design critiques, and strategy sessions that shape the future of applied AI experiences.
What We're Looking For
A strong portfolio demonstrating interactive prototypes and realistic UX flows — ideally showing use of tools like v0.dev, Bolt, or similar.
Experience working across unfamiliar domains — quickly learning how users work today and envisioning how AI can improve their workflows. Solid foundation in user research, journey mapping, and product thinking — with the ability to bring clarity to complex workflows.
Deep expertise with Figma for formal design work, and comfort using no-code or AI-assisted tools for rapid iteration.
Visual design skills with a strong point of view on brand systems, UI identity, and expressive interaction design.
Understanding of accessibility best practices, responsive design, and usability principles.
A builder’s mindset: you enjoy testing ideas quickly and aren’t afraid to discard or change direction based on feedback.
Bonus: Exposure to AI/ML concepts or experience designing AI-powered features or workflows. Bonus: Experience with common front-end coding languages
Why Join Us
The AI space is evolving fast—and you’ll be on the front lines. This is a chance to work in a high-impact environment where your designs won’t sit in decks — they’ll be brought to life. You’ll shape user experiences that blend design, fast prototyping, and AI innovation, while helping define and evolve the Ultralab visual identity as we scale intelligent solutions across industries.

Advantages of joining Turing:

Competitive compensation
Flexible working hours

Here’s how we’re making a difference:
Accelerating developers with AI agents that deliver insights and precision—enabling 5x faster test creation, 30% increase in merge requests, and saving 20 minutes per developer daily.
Automating repetitive tasks, from remediating vulnerabilities (saving teams 1,000+ hours annually) to speeding up migrations that would take years to months.
Enabling innovation by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.
Trusted by 7/10 top software companies by market cap, 4/6 top US banks and many of the companies leading global innovation, like Stripe, Indeed, Tesla, and 1Password, and with $225M in funding from investors like a16z, Sequoia, and Redpoint, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.

Work Where It’s Best for You
Work Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It’s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.
Work Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.
We invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We’re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.

Customer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.
When an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.

What We Do:
We start by collecting the most valuable data for farmers, telling them everything about what is growing on their millions of trees, across thousands of acres of farmland. We do this using advanced camera systems we build, that take pictures of every one of the billions of fruit in a farm. This data lives in our cloud data platform, FruitScope, that we've developed from the ground up to help farmers manage their crops with precision.
Farmers across the nation use our industry-leading software to look at their data, make critical decisions, and command farming operations on a daily basis. Our technology is used today across some of the largest farms in the nation.

Many opportunities to directly influence product development.
Perfect if you are a hardcore engineer who also loves nature.
Comprehensive Health, Vision, and Dental coverage, and we cover 100% of the premium.
Our team is close-knit & highly driven, you’ll work directly with our CEO and entire team.
We’re deeply motivated by the impact we’re making – every line of code written or new system built means less food that goes to waste, and more people who are fed.
What You'll Do:
Deploy, debug, and develop the next generation(s) of our advanced, tractor-mounted camera systems at customer sites, ensuring they perform exceptionally in diverse farm environments.
Work closely with our farmers to deeply understand their operational needs, gather insights, and translate their feedback into real improvements.
Partner with our sales team during customer demonstrations to showcase Orchard's technology to new farmers.

JOB DESCRIPTION

Position Title: Python Developer
Reports to: IT Project Manager of Enterprise Solutions Line of Business
Subsidiary: Leisnoi Professional Services, LLC
Location: Remote
Job Status: Regular Full -Time

SUMMARY:
The U.S. Census Bureau, Demographic Systems Division (DSD) requires support for Python development services in support of DSD’s migration of survey processing systems from Statistical Analysis System (SAS) to Python.

The Python Developer will assist with the development and documentation of the rewrite of The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) production processing system into a Python codebase. The scope of the SIPP Production processing consists of 200+ edit programs. Additionally, a revamped SIPP system, named SIPP Seamless, is currently in its planning phase. Therefore, the work outlined is for supporting the ongoing SIPP production system and the SIPP Seamless system.

As DSD migrates its infrastructure into the cloud, a CI/CD tool is required. Therefore, DSD is creating a collaborative space in GitLab for sharing Python code, where the developed code will reside, and pipelines can be established. The GitLab CI/CD will then need configuration and optimization to emulate current automation for the system.

Additionally, DSD is investigating leveraging a database to replace datasets that have thousands of variables. Therefore, converting the current SAS datasets into a normalized database structure is also in scope. The database research will evaluate the feasibility of replacing datasets to determine optimizations and efficiencies. In the event the database replacement is ideal, the Python Developer will be involved in developing the database design for the SIPP Seamless system.

The scope of work for this position is to provide support to the Income Surveys Programming Branch (ISPB) in The Demographic Systems Division (DSD) for the development of a Python-based system for performing demographic survey editing. DSD needs expertise in developing enterprise, Python solutions from a developer that can effectively cross-train existing staff based on their experience in advanced programming, knowledge of data structures, database experience, and version control familiarity. The Python Developer will work with DSD IT Specialists in an integrated team environment when performing services associated with this contract.

The Python Developer will perform knowledge transfers and training to keep current staff abreast of all activities they have performed and to share knowledge of products and techniques. Additionally, all procedural and development work performed requires clear documentation that can be replicated by current and future staff. This includes clearly documenting and verbally communicating through step-by-step procedures, presentations, explanations of Python coding, configuration settings with rationale, shadowing, and other techniques deemed appropriate by current staff and/or management to ensure adequate knowledge transfer. For technical demonstrations, the Python Developer will use a variety of skills and tools such as Python, SQL, PL/pgSQL, and Shell Scripting. For policy and procedural documentation, the contractor will create procedural documentation using software such as MS PowerPoint, MS Visio, MS Word, MS Excel, MS Teams, and MS SharePoint.

SBIR/STTR Programs:
The SBIR program was established by Congress in 1982 with a statutory purpose to strengthen the role of innovative small business concerns (SBCs) in Federally-funded research or research and development (R/R&D). Specific program purposes are to: (1) Stimulate technological innovation; (2) use small business to meet Federal R/R&D needs; (3) foster and encourage participation by socially and economically disadvantaged SBCs in working in technological innovation; and (4) increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal R/R&D, thereby increasing competition, productivity and economic growth.
The STTR program is a sister program to SBIR, established by Congress in 1992 with a similar statutory purpose as SBIR. A major difference in the two programs is that the STTR requires the small business to have a research partner consisting of a University, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), or a qualified non-profit research institution.
